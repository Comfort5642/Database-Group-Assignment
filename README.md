This project is a relational database system designed to manage the operations of an online bookstore. It supports the management of books, authors, publishers, customers, orders, payments, and shipping. The schema is fully normalized and integrates foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity across all related tables. Sample data includes popular book series like Harry Potter, Goosebumps, and The Da Vinci Code, with accurate mappings between authors, books, and publishers.

The system is tailored to support Kenyan address and payment structures, including localized cities, and customized shipping options like Standard, Express, and Next-Day Delivery. Customers can have multiple addresses with status tracking (e.g., Current, Old), and each order captures detailed order lines, payment method, and shipping information. Historical changes in order status are also tracked for better order management and auditing.

This was a group project developed by three collaborators, with each member contributing to database design, SQL scripting, data population, and documentation. The collaborative effort ensured a functional and realistic implementation that could be extended into a fully featured e-commerce system in future development phases.
